        <h2>When retro hardware is the right choice</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            The modern pursuit of performance has created a mountain of complexity.
            Modern hardware has become an opaque and impenetrable black box so intricate that only a handful of engineers on the planet truly understand it.
            The solution is not to abandon progress, but to rediscover the profound wisdom of retro hardware, not just for nostalgia, but as a superior engineering philosophy, especially for the embedded world.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>It is teachable and hackable</b><br>
            Older harware like Z80 and 6502 are much simpler than modern CPUs.
            It is teachable because you can hold the entire system in your head. 
            This complete understanding is the foundation of true creative control and hackability.
            This understanding is not just academic but it also empowers you to write better, more optimized and creative code because you are no longer guessing what the black box is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>It is reliable and repairable</b><br>
            Complexity is the enemy of reliability.
            A modern SoC has billions of transistors and countless potential points of failure, hidden beneath layers of abstraction and sealed in a package you can not open.
            Simpler hardware, by its nature, is more robust.
            Fewer components mean fewer things can go wrong.
            More importantly, when they do, they are often repairable.
            This philosophy extends beyond the hobbyist's bench.
            The "right to repair" movement is a direct response to the disposable nature of modern complex electronics.
            A system you can not repair is a system you do not truly own.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>It is power efficient</b><br>
            Perhaps the most compelling argument for the embedded scene is that simple hardware consumes less power.
            Every transistor, every clock cycle, every layer of speculative execution in a modern CPU costs energy.
            A simple microcontroller can operate for years on a coin cell battery because its architecture is lean.
            It does not have a complex operating system managing thousands of threads or a multi-gigahertz processor burning watts just to idle.
            In a world of IoT and battery-powered devices, the low power consumption of a simpler architecture is an advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The retro philosophy is used in the best parts of the modern embedded world.
            By looking backward for inspiration, you build something more robust and efficient than you could with the bloated tools of the present.
