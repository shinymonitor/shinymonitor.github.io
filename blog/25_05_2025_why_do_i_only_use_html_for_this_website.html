        <h2>Why do I only use HTML for this website</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            In recent years, websites have become increasingly complex, often at the cost of performance, reliability, and accessibility. Many modern development practices rely on large frameworks and intricate toolchains that can break unexpectedly and require constant maintenance.
            When I first learned to build websites, HTML alone was enough to create engaging, functional pages. Later, HTML5 and CSS replaced some of the simpler, built-in HTML features such as &lt;center&gt;, &lt;font&gt;, and bgcolor. For dynamic content, JavaScript was introduced, a language that is infamous for being extremely repulsive and inefficient.
            For this site, I chose not to use CSS (not even inline styles) or JavaScript at all. Here's why:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Simplicity: </b><br>
            For many websites, especially one like this, all that's needed is text, links, and images.
            HTML already supports these without additional layers of complexity.
            This makes the site easier to write, maintain, and impossible to "break" due to a framework update or dependency issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Speed: </b><br>
            A pure HTML page loads instantly, often faster than a single "Hello World" page created with a modern "groundbreaking" framework.
            Without unnecessary scripts and processing, visitors get the content right away.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Universality: </b><br>
            HTML works everywhere.
            In any browser, on any device, without deployment issues or compatibility concerns.
            Even text-based browsers such as Lynx can display the page exactly as intended.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Content Focused: </b><br>
            By removing decorative distractions, the focus stays on the content itself.
            HTML alone can still handle basic layout and presentation when needed, but the emphasis remains on what the page says, not on visual effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Privacy: </b><br>
            No cookies, no scripts, no tracking.
            Just a page.
            Visitors can read without being monitored or having their data collected.
            The way it's supposed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Longevity: </b><br>
            HTML is a universal language for the web.
            It has been around for decades and will continue to work for decades to come.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don't always need a framework or complex toolchain to build an effective website.
            Start with HTML.
            Add CSS only if you truly need styling.
            Use JavaScript only when interactive features are essential.
            The simpler the foundation, the more accessible, reliable, and enduring your site will be.
        </p>
