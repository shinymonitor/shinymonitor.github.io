        <h2>EFPIX</h2>
        <blockquote>
        <p>
            In a world of growing surveillance, censorship and infrastructure failure, we need protocols that ensure unrestricted communication in the most disconnected and totalitarian environments.
            EFPIX (Encrypted Flood Protocol for Information eXchange) is a topology-agnostic flood-type relay protocol that also achieves end-to-end encryption, plausible deniability for users, untraceability of messages, spam resistance and other optional features.
        </p>
        <h3>Why use EFPIX</h3>
        <p>
            Modern messaging platforms, even encrypted ones, depend on centralized infrastructure which makes them vulnerable to:
            <ul>
                <li>Government surveillance or takedown</li>
                <li>Infrastructure loss</li>
                <li>Metadata leaks</li>
            </ul>
            EFPIX counters this by never requiring a central server but also hiding not only the message content but also sender's and receiver's identities.
        </p>
        <h3>Where to use EFPIX</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Disaster zones where network infrastructure was lost</li>
                <li>Authoritarian Regimes for whistleblowing, journalism and activism where communication is surveilled and cersored</li>
                <li>Space, research, military, or other remote networks where the existence and maintenance of a server is not feasible</li>
                <li>General-purpose privacy focused applications</li>
                <li>Broadcasts like emergency rescue calls, disaster warnings, and news distribution</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What is it designed for</h3>
        <p>
            EFPIX is not optimized for high-bandwidth or ultra-low-latency applications. It is best suited for asynchronous, privacy-critical communication such as secure email, file drops, offline messaging, and distributed alerts.<br>
            <i>"0% performance, 100% security"</i>: EFPIX prioritizes anonymity and resilience over speed. Choose optional features to balance your needs.
        </p>
